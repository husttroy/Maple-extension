The Maple user interface is an approach to enriching code examples on Q\&A sites like Stack Overflow that incorporates API usage mining and user feedback. Programmers often use sites like Stack Overflow to understand API usage, but the reliability of the code examples on these forums is under question. This will reduce the need to cross-check sites for API usage questions and takes advantage of the benefits of using easy-to-understand code examples as opposed to API documentation for learning API usage by enhancing the examples already present in Stack Overflow while also providing other, more reliable ones.

For future work, we would like to qualify the benefits of the Maple UI with a user study, as well as generate code examples for the popups based on the abstract patterns we have in the database.
