\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
Programmers often resort to Stack Overflow to learn about new APIs. Certainly, code snippets on Stack Overflow are supposed to provide a starting point, not necessarily being fully complete or reliable. On the other hand, such incomplete or unreliable snippets can potentially impact the production code, when a programmer mentally or physically reuses a snippet to a target project. 
%Recognizing unreliable snippets requires programmers to cross-check multiple code snippets until finding an ideal usage or extensively test for corner cases, which is difficult due to limited time and attention. 
To bridge the gap, this paper presents a Chrome extension, {\tool} that proactively detects potential API usage violations in a Stack Overflow post and enriches the post with extra tips about correct API usage evidenced by a large number of GitHub snippets. {\tool} could help programmers to implicitly assess a given code snippet on Stack Overflow and reduce the effort of cross-checking and testing the snippet when reusing it to a target project. 

{\bf\em Future work.} We plan to conduct a longitudinal analysis as well as a lab study to evaluate the usefulness of {\tool}. We have instrumented our tool and published it in Chrome Web Store. By collecting the user traces of how they collect aodw
