\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
This paper introduces a Chrome extension, {\tool} that proactively detects API usage violations in a Stack Overflow post and enriches the post with extra API usage tips evidenced by a large number of GitHub code examples. Certainly, SO snippets are supposed to provide a starting point, not necessarily being fully complete or reliable. However, such incomplete or unreliable snippets can potentially impact the production code, when a programmer mentally or physically reuses a snippet to a target project. {\tool} can help programmers implicitly assess a given SO snippet and reduce the effort of cross-checking and testing the snippet when reusing it to a target project. 

{\bf\em Future work.} We plan to conduct a longitudinal study with Stack Overflow users to understand the usefulness of {\tool}. We have instrumented {\tool} to log user interaction behaviors and published it in Chrome Web Store. By analyzing the telemetry data and conducting post surveys, we can gain both quantitative and qualitative insights of the adoption and usage of {\tool} as well as improvement opportunities. We also want to design code completion tasks and conduct a controlled lab study to evaluate whether using {\tool} indeed helps participants write more reliable code.
