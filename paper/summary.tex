\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

{\soa} is an approach to enriching code examples on Q\&A sites like Stack Overflow that incorporates API usage mining and user feedback. Programmers often use sites like Stack Overflow to understand API usage, but the reliability of the code examples on these forums is under question. This will reduce the need to cross-check sites for API usage questions and takes advantage of the benefits of using easy-to-understand code examples as opposed to API documentation for learning API usage by enhancing the examples already present in Stack Overflow while also providing other, more reliable ones. For future work, we would like to conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of {\tool}.
