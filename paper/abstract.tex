\begin{abstract}
Programmers often consult Q\&A websites like Stack Overflow to learn about new APIs. However, such online code examples are not always complete or reliable in terms of API usage. To help programmers assess online code examples, we build a Chrome-extension, {\tool} that contrasts Stack Overflow code examples with API usage patterns learned from GitHub and proactively alerts users about the potential API usage violations. With the assistance of {\tool}, programmers do not need to cross-check multiple examples for proper API usage reference, and can also build confidence about how much a Stack Overflow example is aligned with other similar code snippets in GitHub.
