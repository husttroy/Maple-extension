Programmers often consult Q\&A websites such as Stack Overflow to learn new APIs. However, online code snippets are not always complete or reliable in terms of API usage. We build a Chrome-extension, {\tool} that contrasts Stack Overflow code snippets with API usage patterns learned from GitHub and proactively alerts users about potential limitations or pitfalls in these snippets. With the assistance of {\tool}, programmers do not need to cross-check multiple examples for proper API usage reference, and can also build confidence about how much a Stack Overflow snippet is aligned with other similar code in GitHub. {\tool} is available at Chrome Web Store.\footnote{Download the Chrome extension of {\tool} at \url{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/examplecheck/amliempebckaiaklimcpopomlnklkioe}}
