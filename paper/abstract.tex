 Programmers often consult Q\&A websites like Stack Overflow to learn new APIs. However, such online code examples are not always complete or reliable in terms of API usage. To assess and augment Stack Overflow examples, we present an interactive approach, {\soa} that contrasts code examples with API usage patterns learned from GitHub and alerts users about the potential API usage violations. With the assistance of {\soa}, programmers do not need to cross-check multiple examples for proper API usage reference, and can also build confidence by learning how many other GitHub developers also follow the same practice.
