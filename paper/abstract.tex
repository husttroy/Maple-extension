\begin{abstract}
Programmers often consult Q\&A websites such as Stack Overflow to learn new APIs. However, online code snippets are not always complete or reliable in terms of API usage. To help programmers assess online code snippets, we build a Chrome-extension, {\tool} that detects API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts using patterns mined from 380K GitHub projects. {\tool} quantifies how many GitHub examples follow the correct API usage and also provides the remediation of a detected violation. With the assistance of {\tool}, programmers can easily identify the limitations or pitfalls in a Stack Overflow snippet without cross-checking multiple posts for proper API usage reference. They can also build confidence on a code snippet by learning how much it is aligned with other similar code in GitHub. {\tool} is available at Chrome Web Store\footnote{Download the Chrome extension of {\tool} at \url{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/examplecheck/amliempebckaiaklimcpopomlnklkioe}} and the demo video is available at~\todo{add the youtube video link here}.
