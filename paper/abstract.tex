Programmers often consult Q\&A websites such as Stack Overflow to learn new APIs. However, online code snippets are not always complete or reliable in terms of API usage. To help programmers assess online code snippets, we build a Chrome-extension, {\tool} that detects API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts using patterns mined from 380K GitHub projects. {\tool} quantifies how many GitHub examples follow the correct API usage and also illustrates how to remedy the detected violation in a Stack Overflow snippet. With the assistance of {\tool}, programmers can easily identify the pitfalls of a Stack Overflow snippet and learn how much it disagrees with other similar code in GitHub. {\tool} is available at Chrome Web Store\footnote{Download the Chrome extension of {\tool} at \url{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/examplecheck/amliempebckaiaklimcpopomlnklkioe}} and the demo video is available at~\small{\url{https://youtu.be/X0WIZBa8ETA}}.
